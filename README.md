# ConsoulGame
Made for the 12-hour hackathon Cutie Hack with @cameronzhang1

# Description
This submission for Cutie Hack (organized by the University of California, Riverside) makes use of the Win32 API to enhance the capabilities of a Windows console application.
By creating a modular program that is adaptable for different uses, developers can improve their elementary command line interfaces with GUI elements such as:

* ASCII art frames & animation
* Clickable buttons
* Potential for much more

This command line UI is extremely basic, however in the 12 hours spent originally creating this, we have foreseen several use cases for this program:
* Games
* One-click command line installations
* Applications that require a GUI and command line element

In the future, we hope to further expand on this application by adding support for 24-bit colors and improving portability.
